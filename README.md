![Image of Nathaniel trapped inside a computer](http://i.imgur.com/azol0t9.png "Image of Nathaniel trapped inside a computer")

Experiments with code generation in C and MIPS. Currently targeting the MARSBot graphics turtle that ships with MARS4.4, may later add code generation for other applications.

Python code ~~may find~~ has found its way into the repo ~~later~~ as well.
